# NYC Rideshare Treatment Effect Benchmark

A JAX-accelerated, high-fidelity rideshare simulation for evaluating treatment effect estimation methods using real Manhattan street network and taxi data.

## Overview

This benchmark provides a realistic NYC rideshare simulation environment with enhanced driver dynamics for testing causal inference algorithms. Built with JAX for scalable batch processing and vectorized driver behavior modeling.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
poetry install

# Run NYC rideshare simulation demo
poetry run python run_rideshare_demo.py
